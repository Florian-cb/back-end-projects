# back-end-projects

1. Blackjack

Logic code for a simple blackjack game that follows traditional game rules.
The user plays against a dealer. To win your hand value must be higher than the dealer's. 
Two cards are generated initially for both the player and dealer. You can only see one of the cards from the dealer. 
You may choose to Hit and be dealt another card or Stay. If your hand value is larger than 21 that is considered a bust and you automatically loose. If you didn't bust and you decide to stay, the dealer's second card will be revealed and he will draw until he reaches at least a hand value of 17 or higher.
You can choose to Quit anytime by inserting 'Q'. 
Runs as a console application to demonstrate successful back-end logic without a GUI.
Built 100% in Java.
